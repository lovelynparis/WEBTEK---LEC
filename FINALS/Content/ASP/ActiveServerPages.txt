ASP.NET Life Cycle
 - ASP.NET processess pages to produce dynamic output
 - The application and its pages are instantiated and processed
 - ASP.NET compiles the pages dynamically
 - ASP.NET Life Cycle divided into 2 parts:
	* Application Life Cycle
	  -Application life cycle has the following stages:
	    1. User makes a request for accessing application resource, a page. Browser sends this request to the web server.
  	    2. A unified pipeline receives the first request and the following events take place:
 		i. An object of the class ApplicationManager is created.
		ii. An object of the class HostingEnvironment is created to provide information regarding the resources.
		iii. Top level items in the application are compiled.
 	    3. Response objects are created. The application objects such as HttpContext, HttpRequest and HttpResponse are created and initialized.
	    4. An instance of the HttpApplication object is created and assigned to the request.
	    5. The request is processed by the HttpApplication class. Different events are raised by this class for processing the request.
	* Page Life Cycle
	  -The page life cycle phases are:
		/ Initialization
		/ Instantiation of the controls on the page
		/ Restoration and maintenance of the state
		/ Execution of the event handler codes
		/ Page rendering

	  - Different Stages of ASP.NET Page:
		* Page Request
		* Starting of page life cycle
		* Page initialization
		* Page load
		* Validation
		* Postback event handling
		* Page rendering
		* Unload

		* Init
		* InitComplete
		* LoadViewState
		* LoadPostData
		* PreLoad
		* Load
		* LoadComplete
